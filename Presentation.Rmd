## Slide 1: Introduction

Welcome to the **Interactive Hypothesis Testing** app!  
This app allows you to interact with hypothesis tests, including t-tests and z-tests.

You can adjust parameters to see how the test statistic and p-value change, and make decisions based on the results.

## Slide 2: Objective of the App

The purpose of this app is to help users understand hypothesis testing by visually demonstrating:
- How to set up test parameters (sample size, sample mean, etc.)
- The calculation of the test statistic
- The decision-making process based on the p-value


## Slide 3: Interactivity and Features

**Interactive Features**:
- **Sliders** for setting sample size, sample mean, standard deviation, and significance level.
- **Real-time calculation** of the test statistic (t or z) and p-value.
- **Visual representation** of the test statistic on a normal distribution plot.



## Slide 4: R Code for Test Statistic Calculation

The test statistic (t or z) is computed using the formula:

```
test_stat <- (sample_mean - pop_mean) / (sample_sd / sqrt(sample_size))
p_value <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(test_stat)))
```

This code is executed when the sliders are adjusted to update the test statistic and p-value dynamically.

## Conclusions

This app helps users visualize the results of hypothesis testing in a simple and interactive way.
It is useful for students, professionals, and anyone wanting to better understand hypothesis testing.

Thank you for your attention!
